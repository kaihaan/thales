# Search Module

This module contains the core logic for the RAG system. It is responsible for orchestrating the search process, combining results from different sources, and providing the main entry point for context retrieval via the `RAGAgent`.

## Core Components

- `RAGAgent` (in `agent.py`): A specialized agent that inherits from `BaseAgent`. It uses the `VectorStore` and `GraphDatabase` components to retrieve and rank context based on a natural language query.
- Ranking and Filtering Logic (in `ranking.py`): Functions to combine, rank, and filter the results from the vector and graph searches to produce the most relevant final context.

## High-Level TODOs

- [ ] Implement the `RAGAgent` class in an `agent.py` file.
- [ ] Develop the ranking and filtering algorithms in a `ranking.py` file.
- [ ] Integrate the `VectorStore` and `GraphDatabase` components.
- [ ] Add tests for the `retrieve_context` workflow.
