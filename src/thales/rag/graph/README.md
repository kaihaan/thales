# Graph Module

This module provides the necessary abstractions for interacting with graph databases. It defines a common `GraphDatabase` interface to ensure that different graph database backends can be used interchangeably.

## Core Components

- `GraphDatabase` (in `base.py`): An abstract base class defining the standard methods for querying and traversing the graph (e.g., `get_connected_nodes`, `query`).
- `Neo4jDatabase` (in `neo4j_impl.py`): A concrete implementation of the `GraphDatabase` interface for Neo4j.

## High-Level TODOs

- [ ] Define the `GraphDatabase` abstract base class in a `base.py` file.
- [ ] Implement the `Neo4jDatabase` class.
- [ ] Add connection management and error handling.
- [ ] Create tests to validate the Neo4j implementation.
