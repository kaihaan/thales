# Next Development Priorities

## Current Status: BaseAgent Complete ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Working AI Agent with goal execution
- ‚úÖ MCP client integration functional
- ‚úÖ Ontology system tested and debugged
- ‚úÖ Basic agent testing validated

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: LLM Integration for Goal Decomposition üéØ
**Why**: Transform from hardcoded task decomposition to intelligent goal processing
**Impact**: Makes agents truly "intelligent" rather than just task executors
**Effort**: 1-2 sessions

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Create LLM Abstraction Layer** (`src/thales/llm/`)
   - `LLMClient` interface for provider abstraction
   - OpenAI client implementation (start with GPT-4)
   - Prompt templates for goal decomposition

2. **Enhance Goal Processing** (`src/thales/agents/ontology/`)
   - `GoalProcessor` class using LLM for task decomposition
   - Natural language goal ‚Üí structured tasks conversion
   - Context-aware task generation

3. **Update BaseAgent**
   - Replace hardcoded `plan_goal_execution()` with LLM-powered version
   - Add goal complexity assessment
   - Implement dynamic task creation

**Test Goals**:
- "Analyze the sales data in quarterly_report.csv and create a summary"
- "Help me organize my project files by creating a proper directory structure"
- "Calculate compound interest for a $10,000 investment over 5 years at 7% APR"

### Priority 2: Interactive Agent Mode ü§ù
**Why**: Enable human-in-the-loop decision making and explanation
**Impact**: Makes agents collaborative rather than autonomous-only
**Effort**: 1 session

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Interactive Execution Mode**
   - Add `execution_mode` parameter to BaseAgent
   - Implement decision confirmation prompts
   - Add explanation generation for agent actions

2. **Human Feedback Integration**
   - Tool selection confirmation
   - Goal clarification requests
   - Progress reporting and intervention points

3. **Decision Explanation System**
   - Why agent chose specific tools
   - How goals were decomposed
   - What the agent learned from execution

### Priority 3: Tool Discovery Engine üîç
**Why**: Dynamic tool selection based on goal requirements
**Impact**: Agents become adaptive to available tools
**Effort**: 1-2 sessions

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **ToolDiscoveryEngine** (`src/thales/agents/tools/`)
   - Capability matching (goal requirements ‚Üí available tools)
   - Tool ranking and selection algorithms
   - Semantic tool registry

2. **Enhanced MCP Integration**
   - Automatic server discovery
   - Tool capability analysis
   - Performance-based tool selection

### Priority 4: Specialized Agent Types üé≠
**Why**: Domain-specific optimization and behavior
**Impact**: Agents optimized for specific use cases
**Effort**: 1 session per agent type

**Agent Types to Implement**:
1. **RAGAgent** - Knowledge retrieval and synthesis
2. **CodeAgent** - Programming and development tasks
3. **ResearchAgent** - Information gathering and analysis
4. **FileAgent** - File management and organization

## Strategic Considerations

### Short-term Focus (Next 2-3 Sessions)
**Recommended Path**: Priority 1 (LLM Integration) ‚Üí Priority 2 (Interactive Mode)
**Rationale**: These provide the biggest leap in agent intelligence and usability

### Medium-term Goals (Following 3-4 Sessions)
- Tool Discovery Engine
- Specialized Agent Types
- Agent Memory Systems
- Multi-Agent Coordination

### Long-term Vision (Phase C & Beyond)
- Knowledge Graph RAG integration
- Multi-agent workflows
- Professional package development

## Implementation Strategy

### Session 1: LLM Foundation
1. Create LLM abstraction layer
2. Implement OpenAI client
3. Basic prompt templates

### Session 2: Intelligent Goal Processing
1. LLM-powered goal decomposition
2. Update BaseAgent integration
3. Test with complex goals

### Session 3: Interactive Mode
1. Human-in-the-loop execution
2. Decision explanation system
3. Feedback integration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- Agent can decompose natural language goals into executable tasks
- Human can interact with and guide agent execution
- Agent explains its reasoning and decisions

### Educational Goals
- Deep understanding of LLM integration patterns
- Human-AI collaboration design
- Prompt engineering for agent systems

### Project Value
- Agents become genuinely useful for real-world tasks
- Foundation for advanced agent capabilities
- Reusable patterns for future agent development

## Recommendation: Start with Priority 1 (LLM Integration)

**Why this is the best next step**:
1. **Biggest Impact**: Transforms agents from scripted to intelligent
2. **Foundation for Everything**: Other features depend on smart goal processing
3. **Immediate Value**: Makes agents useful for real tasks
4. **Learning Opportunity**: Core AI agent development skill
5. **Natural Progression**: Builds on solid BaseAgent foundation

**Specific Starting Point**: Create the LLM abstraction layer and implement OpenAI integration for goal decomposition.
