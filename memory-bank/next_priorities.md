# Next Development Priorities

## Current Status: `_Knowledge` class refactored ✅
- ✅ Internal `_Knowledge` class provides persistent session and message storage.
- ✅ In-memory caching implemented for efficient message retrieval.
- ✅ All outstanding `Mypy` errors and logical bugs have been resolved.

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Complete the Knowledge Class 🎯
**Why**: The public-facing `Knowledge` class is needed to provide a clean, safe interface to the agent's memory systems.
**Impact**: Encapsulates the internal `_Knowledge` class, providing a robust and easy-to-use API for the `BaseAgent`.
**Effort**: <1 session

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Create `Knowledge` Wrapper Class** (`src/thales/agents/base/ontology/knowledge/knowledge.py`)
   - This class will be a context manager.
   - It will instantiate and hold the internal `_Knowledge` object.
   - It will expose a simplified, public API for managing sessions and messages.

2. **Implement Public-Facing Methods**
   - `start_session`: Proxies to the internal `_Knowledge` method.
   - `add_message`: Proxies to the internal `_Knowledge` method.
   - `get_history`: Proxies to the internal `_Knowledge` method.
   - `register_tool`, `discover_and_add_tools`, `use_tool`: Proxies to the internal `_Knowledge` methods.

3. **Update `BaseAgent`**
   - Modify the `BaseAgent` to use the new `Knowledge` class instead of directly instantiating `_Knowledge`.

**Test Goals**:
- Verify that the `BaseAgent` can still create and manage sessions through the new `Knowledge` class.
- Confirm that message history is correctly persisted and retrieved.

### Priority 2: LLM Integration for Goal Decomposition
**Why**: Transform from hardcoded task decomposition to intelligent goal processing
**Impact**: Makes agents truly "intelligent" rather than just task executors
**Effort**: 1-2 sessions

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Create LLM Abstraction Layer** (`src/thales/llm/`)
   - `LLMClient` interface for provider abstraction
   - OpenAI client implementation (start with GPT-4)
   - Prompt templates for goal decomposition

2. **Enhance Goal Processing** (`src/thales/agents/ontology/`)
   - `GoalProcessor` class using LLM for task decomposition
   - Natural language goal → structured tasks conversion
   - Context-aware task generation

3. **Update BaseAgent**
   - Replace hardcoded `plan_goal_execution()` with LLM-powered version
   - Add goal complexity assessment
   - Implement dynamic task creation

### Priority 3: Interactive Agent Mode 🤝
**Why**: Enable human-in-the-loop decision making and explanation
**Impact**: Makes agents collaborative rather than autonomous-only
**Effort**: 1 session

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Interactive Execution Mode**
   - Add `execution_mode` parameter to BaseAgent
   - Implement decision confirmation prompts
   - Add explanation generation for agent actions

2. **Human Feedback Integration**
   - Tool selection confirmation
   - Goal clarification requests
   - Progress reporting and intervention points

3. **Decision Explanation System**
   - Why agent chose specific tools
   - How goals were decomposed
   - What the agent learned from execution

## Strategic Considerations

### Short-term Focus (Next 2-3 Sessions)
**Recommended Path**: Priority 1 (Complete Knowledge Class) → Priority 2 (LLM Integration)
**Rationale**: Completing the `Knowledge` class provides a stable foundation for the more advanced features to come.

### Medium-term Goals (Following 3-4 Sessions)
- Tool Discovery Engine
- Specialized Agent Types
- Agent Memory Systems
- Multi-Agent Coordination

### Long-term Vision (Phase C & Beyond)
- Knowledge Graph RAG integration
- Multi-agent workflows
- Professional package development

## Implementation Strategy

### Session 1: Complete Knowledge Class
1. Create `Knowledge` wrapper class.
2. Implement public-facing proxy methods.
3. Update `BaseAgent` to use the new class.

### Session 2: LLM Foundation
1. Create LLM abstraction layer
2. Implement OpenAI client
3. Basic prompt templates

### Session 3: Intelligent Goal Processing
1. LLM-powered goal decomposition
2. Update BaseAgent integration
3. Test with complex goals

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- `_Knowledge` class is properly encapsulated.
- `BaseAgent` uses a clean, public API for memory management.
- Agent can decompose natural language goals into executable tasks.

### Educational Goals
- Understanding of API design and encapsulation.
- Deep understanding of LLM integration patterns.
- Human-AI collaboration design.

### Project Value
- A robust, reusable memory system for agents.
- Agents become genuinely useful for real-world tasks.
- Foundation for advanced agent capabilities.

## Recommendation: Start with Priority 1 (Complete the Knowledge Class)

**Why this is the best next step**:
1. **Good Software Design**: Encapsulating the internal `_Knowledge` class is a best practice.
2. **Stability**: Provides a stable API for the rest of the agent to build upon.
3. **Quick Win**: This is a small, well-defined task that can be completed quickly.
4. **Natural Progression**: Logically follows from the refactoring of the `_Knowledge` class.

**Specific Starting Point**: Create the `Knowledge` wrapper class and update the `BaseAgent` to use it.
