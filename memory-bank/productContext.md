# Product Context: Modular AI Agent Learning Project

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Creating effective AI Agents requires understanding multiple complex domains: agent architectures, tool integration, knowledge retrieval, multi-agent coordination, and memory systems. Most learning resources focus on individual components rather than providing a comprehensive, hands-on approach to building production-ready agent systems.

### Educational Gap

- **Toy Examples**: Most tutorials use simple examples that don't translate to real-world complexity
- **Integration Complexity**: Limited guidance on combining MCP tools, Knowledge Graph RAG, and multi-agent patterns
- **Production Readiness**: Gap between learning exercises and deployable agent systems
- **Best Practices**: Lack of established patterns for agent design, memory management, and coordination
