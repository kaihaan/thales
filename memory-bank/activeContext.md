# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: Foundation Completion & Agent Framework Planning

### What We're Working On Right Now

**Primary Focus**: Completing the MCP foundation (Phase 4) and planning the transition to AI Agent Framework development.

**Immediate Task**: Finalizing MCP client cleanup issues and preparing for the expanded Agent Framework implementation.

### Project Evolution

The project has evolved from a focused MCP learning exercise to a comprehensive **Modular AI Agent Learning Project** with the following expanded scope:

#### New Core Objectives
1. **Education**: Learn AI Agents, Python package development, MCP, Knowledge Graph RAG, and Agent design patterns
2. **Reusable Package**: Create a flexible AI Agent framework for future projects
3. **Good Coding Habits**: Robust planning, incremental development, testing, and documentation

#### Expanded Technical Goals
- **Agent Framework**: Modular system that takes Goals as input and discovers relevant tools
- **Knowledge Graph RAG**: AI Agent as tool for pulling relevant context from Knowledge Graphs
- **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Support for best-practice multi-agent design patterns
- **Agent Memory**: Short-term and long-term semantic memory systems
- **LLM Flexibility**: Support for most suitable LLM per task

### Recent Progress (MCP Foundation - Phases 1-4)

#### ‚úÖ Completed MCP Foundation

1. **Phase 1: Cline MCP Integration** - Successfully configured Cline with filesystem and math servers
2. **Phase 2: Configuration System** - Implemented `MCPConfigManager` with dataclass patterns
3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Client** - Built custom MCP client with connection management (85% complete)
4. **Phase 4: Testing & Validation** - Comprehensive test suite (75% complete - cleanup pending)

#### üîß Current MCP Technical Challenge

**Asyncio Cleanup Issue**: Test suite runs successfully but generates cleanup warnings on Windows.

**Status**: Cosmetic warnings only - core MCP functionality is complete and working.

### Active Development Areas

#### 1. MCP Foundation Completion (Current Priority)

**Files**: 
- `thales/src/thales/mcp/tests/test_enhanced_client.py` - Fix asyncio cleanup
- `thales/src/thales/mcp/client/client.py` - Standardize interface

**Goal**: Complete the MCP foundation as a solid base for the Agent Framework

#### 2. Agent Framework Architecture Planning (Next Priority)

**New Focus Areas**:
- **Goal Processing**: How agents interpret and decompose goals
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic discovery of relevant MCP servers/tools
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: RAG system using Knowledge Graphs
- **Agent Memory Systems**: Short-term and semantic memory patterns
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Communication and collaboration patterns

#### 3. Package Structure Planning

**Target Structure**:

```

### Current Technical State

#### Working MCP Foundation
- ‚úÖ **Cline Integration**: Filesystem server accessible through Cline interface
- ‚úÖ **Server Configurations**: Centralized management of MCP server settings
- ‚úÖ **Client Connections**: Multi-server connection management
- ‚úÖ **Tool Execution**: Math and filesystem operations validated
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive integration tests

#### Known Issues (Minor)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Asyncio Cleanup**: Cosmetic subprocess cleanup warnings on Windows
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Method Consistency**: Minor client interface standardization needed

### Immediate Next Steps

#### Priority 1: Complete MCP Foundation
**Goal**: Finish Phase 4 to provide solid foundation for Agent Framework
**Tasks**:
1. Fix asyncio cleanup warnings in test suite
2. Standardize client interface methods
3. Complete any remaining MCP documentation

#### Priority 2: Agent Framework Architecture
**Goal**: Design the expanded Agent Framework architecture
**Tasks**:
1. Research Agent design patterns and best practices
2. Design Goal processing and decomposition system
3. Plan Tool discovery mechanisms
4. Architect Knowledge Graph RAG integration
5. Design Agent memory systems (short-term + semantic)
6. Plan Multi-Agent coordination patterns

#### Priority 3: Implementation Planning
**Goal**: Create detailed implementation roadmap for Agent Framework
**Tasks**:
1. Define package structure and module organization
2. Plan incremental development phases
3. Design testing strategy for Agent components
4. Plan LLM abstraction layer for flexibility

### Development Environment Context

#### Current Setup
- **Platform**: Windows 10 with asyncio ProactorEventLoop
- **Python**: 3.12.9 with virtual environment
- **MCP SDK**: Official Python SDK installed and working
- **Project Structure**: Solid MCP foundation ready for expansion

#### Key Dependencies (Current + Planned)
- **Current**: `mcp`, `python-dotenv`, custom logger utilities
- **Planned**: LLM libraries, Knowledge Graph libraries, Agent frameworks

### Context for Next Session

**Immediate Focus**: Complete MCP foundation cleanup (asyncio warnings)
**Strategic Focus**: Begin Agent Framework architecture planning
**Success Criteria**: 
- MCP tests run without warnings
- Clear Agent Framework architecture documented
- Implementation roadmap defined

**Key Transition**: Moving from MCP learning project to comprehensive Agent Framework development while leveraging the solid MCP foundation already built.

The MCP work provides an excellent foundation - we now have:
- Working tool discovery and execution patterns
- Configuration management systems
- Testing frameworks
- Real-world integration experience

This foundation will be invaluable for the expanded Agent Framework where MCP servers become the "tools" that agents discover and use to accomplish their goals.
