# Project Brief: MCP Learning & Integration

## Core Objective

Learn and implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration by adding the filesystem MCP server to an educational project, developing both user and developer perspectives of MCP systems.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Educational MCP Implementation

- **User Perspective**: Configure and use MCP servers through existing tools (Cline)
- **Developer Perspective**: Build custom MCP client from scratch
- **Comparative Learning**: Understand MCP through both consumption and creation

### 2. Filesystem Server Integration

- Add official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` to project
- Enable secure file operations within project boundaries
- Test and validate filesystem tool execution

### 3. Custom Client Development

- Build `EnhancedMCPClient` with configuration management
- Implement multi-server connection handling
- Create comprehensive testing framework

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Reference Implementation (Completed)

- Configure Cline MCP settings for immediate filesystem access
- Establish working reference for comparison and debugging

### Phase 2: Configuration System (Completed)

- Create centralized MCP server configuration management
- Implement `MCPConfigManager` with dataclass patterns
- Support multiple server types (NPX, Python, future HTTP)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Client (In Progress)

- Build production-ready MCP client
- Implement connection lifecycle management
- Add interactive testing capabilities

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Current Focus)

- Comprehensive tool execution tests
- Multi-server integration validation
- Performance and reliability testing

### Phase 5: Documentation & Extension (Planned)

- Usage documentation and examples
- Additional server integrations
- Advanced client features

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Filesystem server accessible through Cline
- âœ… Custom client can connect to and execute tools on multiple servers
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite validates all functionality
- ðŸ“‹ Clear documentation enables project extension
- ðŸ“‹ Educational value demonstrates both MCP consumption and creation

## Technical Constraints

- **Security**: Filesystem access limited to project directory
- **Platform**: Windows development environment with asyncio considerations
- **Dependencies**: Official MCP Python SDK, minimal external requirements
- **Architecture**: Modular design supporting future server additions

## Educational Value

This project teaches:

- MCP protocol fundamentals
- Async Python programming patterns
- Configuration management systems
- Test-driven development
- Client-server architecture
- Tool integration patterns
