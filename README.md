> A hands-on learning project for understanding AI agents through building with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What This Project Is

**Thales** is an educational project that teaches AI agent development by starting with a solid MCP foundation and gradually building toward more advanced agent capabilities. The focus is on learning by doing, with each component built to understand the underlying concepts.

## Current Achievements

### âœ… MCP Foundation (Complete)
- **Custom MCP Client**: Multi-server connection management with async resource handling
- **Cline Integration**: Immediate filesystem and math operations through Cline interface
- **Configuration System**: Type-safe server configuration with centralized management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validated tool execution across filesystem and math operations
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and resource cleanup

### âœ… Agent Framework (In Progress)
- **Base Agent Structure**: Core agent classes with goal/task management
- **Agent Ontology**: Identity, capabilities, and behavior framework
- **Goal Processing**: Basic goal execution and task decomposition

## Longer-term Vision

The project aims to evolve into a modular agent framework supporting:

- **Goal-Driven Agents**: Natural language goals converted to actionable tasks
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatic selection of relevant MCP servers and tools
- **Knowledge Graph RAG**: Enhanced context retrieval using graph relationships
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Collaborative agent workflows
- **Educational Package**: Reusable components for learning and future projects

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js (for NPX-based MCP servers)

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd thales
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Try It Now
```bash
cd src

# Test the MCP client
python -m thales.mcp.client.client local-math

# Run comprehensive tests
python -m thales.mcp.tests.test_enhanced_client
```

## Current Status

**Phase A (MCP Foundation)**: âœ… Complete - Production-ready MCP client with comprehensive testing

**Phase B (Agent Framework)**: ðŸ”§ In Progress - Basic agent structure implemented, goal processing underway

**Phase C (Advanced Features)**: ðŸ“‹ Planned - Knowledge graph RAG, multi-agent patterns

## Contributing

This is primarily an educational project, but contributions that enhance the learning experience are welcome. Please maintain the focus on clear, understandable implementations over complex optimizations.
